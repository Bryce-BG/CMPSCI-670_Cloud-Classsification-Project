# CMPSCI-670_Cloud-Classsification-Project

Team members: Bryce Bodley-Gomes, Kaivankumar

Our project was to use mask RCNN as a model and then analyze why current models were achieving such low accuracy on the classification tasks given in the Kaggle challenge: https://www.kaggle.com/c/understanding_cloud_organization


This repo is a submission of most of the files we used to create and analyze our model's performance.
Our writeup details our analysis and results in: Final Cloud Classification Project Writeup.pdf
